## Mathematics of Data Science

This is the material of the Master's lecture *Mathematics of Data Science* which I taught in 2025/2026 at the University of Vienna.

The lecture is still ongoing, so material for the last two blocks will soon be added!

The course covers:

- Kolmogorov axioms, Bayes theorem, Random numbers, Random distributions, Moment-generating functions, Central Limit Theorem, Law of Large Numbers, Chernoff Bounds, Hoeffding's inequality, Shannon entropy
- Intuition in many dimensions, dimensionality reduction (PCA, Diffusion Maps, Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma), Marcenko-Pastur distribution, kmeans clustering, DBSCAN, spectral clustering
- PageRank, Matrix factorization (SVD, Funk algorithm, NNMF), Knowledge graph embedding (DeepWalk, RESCAL, TransE), Graph Neural Networks
- Risk, Hypothesis sets, Empirical Risk Minimization, Linear & polynomial regression, Universal approximation, (Stone-)Weierstrass theorem
- ...

The main notes of the lecture are the slides (provided as pptx and pdf), with in-depth calculations found as handwritten notes. Moreover, for some blocks, coding exercises or code examples are provided.
